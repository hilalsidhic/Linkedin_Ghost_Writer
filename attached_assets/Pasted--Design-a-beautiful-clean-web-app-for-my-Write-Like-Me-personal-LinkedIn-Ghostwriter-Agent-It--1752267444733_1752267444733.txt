**“Design a beautiful, clean web app for my ‘Write Like Me’ personal LinkedIn Ghostwriter Agent.
It should feel modern, trustworthy, and effortless — like a premium SaaS onboarding flow.

🎯 User Journey
Step 1 — LinkedIn Profile Input:

Top section: a big, centered input field labeled “Paste Your LinkedIn Profile URL”

Subtext below: “We’ll help you export your posts. Don’t worry, nothing is stored on our servers.”

Add a clear instruction card or collapsible FAQ:

How to export your posts:
1️⃣ Go to your LinkedIn Profile → Activity → Posts
2️⃣ Expand all posts you want the AI to learn from
3️⃣ Scroll down to load more
4️⃣ Right-click → Save As → choose Webpage, Single File (.mhtml)

Step 2 — Upload MHTML File:

Elegant file drop zone: drag & drop or click to select.

Accept .mhtml only, show file name & size.

Show progress bar or file preview icon.

Add a tiny helper text: “We only read this file locally to analyze your style.”

Step 3 — Analyze My Writing Style:

Large primary CTA button: “🔍 Analyze My Posts”

On click:

Show spinner or a fun progress animation.

Display a stylish card: “✨ Your Unique Writing Style” with the output nicely formatted — headings, bullet points, or highlighted keywords.

Step 4 — Generate a New Post:

Below style summary, a new section:

Label: “What do you want to write about next?”

Clean multi-line text input for topic ideas or bullet points.

Button: “✏️ Generate Post”

On click: show AI magic — display the generated post in a beautiful, readable block, with a “Copy to Clipboard” button and maybe a subtle confetti animation when done.

🌟 Design Style
Clean, bright, minimal.

Friendly rounded fonts (e.g., Inter, Nunito, or a modern sans-serif).

Soft shadows, rounded cards, subtle hover animations.

Highlight brand color (e.g., LinkedIn blue accent) for buttons and headings.

Use clear step dividers — maybe numbered badges: 1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣

⚙️ Technical Details
Tech stack: React or Next.js with Tailwind CSS (or Chakra if you like).

Add dummy API calls for /analyze and /generate endpoints — use placeholders.

Mobile responsive: center aligned on all devices.

Optional: Tiny footer note: “Built with ❤️ for the AI Agent Challenge.”

Deliver a single clean page that feels like a delightful onboarding flow — the user should feel excited, confident, and safe sharing their writing style with the AI.”
